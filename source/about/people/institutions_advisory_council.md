# Institutions Advisory Council

The Institutions Advisory Council represents the scholarly communications community, 
including librarians and information science and publishing professionals. The overall 
role of the Institutions Advisory Council is to represent the voice of the community and to 
provide advice and guidance to the arXiv Advisory Board on issues guiding the 
sustainability and success of arXiv, including mission, vision, strategy and budget. 


The Institutions Advisory Council advises on issues related to scholarly communication, 
publishing, standards, open access and open science; issues related to membership 
program and policy; arXiv services, interoperability and advocacy to the community; user 
needs, metadata, technical and user trends; matters that may transcend its own remit 
with relevant parties within arXiv and creates avenues for regular community input and 
responds to such input.
