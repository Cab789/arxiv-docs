Papers in HTML Format
The request to offer arXiv-hosted papers in HTML format comes directly from scientists with disabilities who face barriers to accessing the research they need. Learn more about how arXiv has added papers in HTML format to our existing PDF and source options to improve accessibility and access for all.

# HTML as an accessible format for papers

Open access above all, for all. Accessibility issues in research are not new, but they are urgent. The message we have heard from our community is that arXiv can have the most impact in the shortest time by offering HTML alongside the existing PDF and source files. While there is much work to be done on accessibility in science, research papers that are accessible to all is a goal within our reach.

## Latest updates
The HTML papers project has reached a milestone: having completed our targeted Public Experimental Phase, we have launched accessible HTML in Beta for all papers on arXiv. The link to the Experimental HTML format will appear on all abstract pages as a download option, and authors will review their paper’s HTML as a part of their submission process. We continue to solicit feedback from authors, readers, and the entire arXiv community to improve conversions and promote accessibility for all.

## Why "Experimental" HTML?
Did you know that 90% of submissions to arXiv are in TeX format, mostly LaTeX? That poses a unique accessibility challenge: to accurately convert from TeX, a very extensible language used in myriad unique ways by authors, to HTML, where it can be legible for screen readers.

Because of this challenge, we know there will be mistakes. We have decided to launch in Beta with “experimental” HTML because:

1. Accessibility is needed now. We have polled the arXiv community, especially researchers with accessibility needs, and they overwhelmingly asked us not to wait. Good and “right now” will have a greater positive impact than perfect, but “later”.
2. We need your help. Our team has found and corrected the most glaring issues, but now that we have launched across all arXiv papers, we need you to help us find further issues that create barriers to accessibility. Reports from the community will help us identify issues we can track back to specific LaTeX packages that are not converting correctly. 

## How to help

### Report an issue
- Go to the abstract page for a paper you are interested in reading.
- Look in the section where you find the link to the PDF download, and click the new link for HTML.
- Report conversion issues you see by either 
- a) clicking on the Open Issue button 
- b) selecting text and clicking on the Open Issue for Selection button or
- c) use **Ctrl+?** on your keyboard. If you are using a screen reader, use **Alt+y** to toggle accessible reporting buttons per paragraph.

**Please do not create reports that the HTML paper doesn't look exactly like the PDF paper.**

Our goal for this project is to make papers more accessible, so the key in beta is to value function over form. HTML layouts that are incorrect or are illegible are important to report. But we do expect the HTML papers to present differently than the same paper rendered in PDF. Line breaks will occur in different places and there is likely to be more white space. In general, the HTML paper won't present as compactly. Intricate typographic layouts will not be rendered so intricately. This is by design. 

HTML is a different medium and brings its own advantages versus PDF -- aside from being much more friendly to screen readers, HTML does a far better job adapting to the characteristics of the device you're reading on -- whether that's your particular monitor geometry or your smartphone.

### Help with conversion issues
- Once a package issue is identified, it still needs to be corrected to improve accessibility
- If you are a developer with a free development cycle, help us improve conversions!
- Our collaborators at LaTeXML maintain a [list of issues in GitHub](https://github.com/brucemiller/LaTeXML/issues) related to packages that need conversion, and welcome feedback and developer contributions

## Project collaborators
First, we want to share a special thank you to all the scientists with disabilities who have generously shared their insights, expertise, and guidance throughout this project.

We are working closely with two organizations on this effort: The [LaTeX Project](https://www.latex-project.org/), and the [LaTeXML](https://math.nist.gov/~BMiller/LaTeXML/) team from NIST. We deeply thank each member of these teams for their knowledge, incredible work, and commitment to accessibility.
