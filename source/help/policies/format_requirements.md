# Policies for Format Requirements

All submissions to arXiv must meet the standards for [moderation and scholarly interest](/help/moderation/index.html).

Authors should use the following format requirements. As part of moderation we may ask for other requirements on an individual basis.

## Submissions should have:

- Complete references
- Author list (no anonymous submissions)
- Machine readability
- Single spaced text
- 10 to 14 point type
- Minimum 1" page margin

## Submissions should not have:
- Line numbers
- Watermarks that obstruct the text
- Advertisements of any kind
- Highlighted text
- Margin notes
- Referee remarks
- Copyright statements which prohibit or impair arXivâ€™s redistribution license

There are additional requirements based on the files submitted.

- [LaTeX/PDFLaTeX source requirements](https://info.arxiv.org/help/submit_tex.html)
- [PDF source requirements](/help/submit_pdf.html)

If your submission does not meet these requirements, it may be returned to you for correction.
