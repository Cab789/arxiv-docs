# Policies for specific content types


## Conference proceedings

Please refer to [Submission of indexes for conference proceedings](/help/submit_index.html)


## Translations

Please refer to the page on [Translations](/help/translations.html)


## Books

Most submissions to arXiv are research articles, but we do accept other content types, including books and book chapters. Similar to article submissions, books and book chapters should be self-contained research with novel results or current reviews that are of interest to professional researchers in the field. Textbooks and books that are not research are not typically accepted. There are some exceptions though.

### Books as complete works

Books are acceptable as complete manuscripts as long as they are of interest. This format is preferred if the individual chapters are all by the same author(s).

### Individual book chapters

Individual book chapters may be submitted and will be moderated by the same standards as research articles.

### Book Front matter/Introductions/Appendices

An Introduction chapter or Appendix section would not typically be accepted on its own as they are not self-contained or of interest. In order to allow for a complete book to be posted to arXiv, where the chapters are submitted individually, we will allow a submission for the “non-research” sections of the book when:
The front matter, introductory chapters, appendices, etc. are combined into a submission that includes links to the individual chapters that are on arXiv. 


## Comments and Reply to Comments

arXiv encourages dialogue and debate about scientific matters. Normally this occurs via a series of papers that build on or critically examine each other. These are moderated each individually as standalone papers. Sometimes, a remark on or note about another paper that is not a full standalone paper is of sufficient interest to arXiv readers. These can be put on arXiv as so-called "comments-on" papers. All normal moderation criteria apply to these, except that they need not be complete standalone papers.

Requirements for Comments and Replies:

- "Comments-on" content type must have a Title: "Comment(s) on '<title-of-original-paper>'" and the Comments field must contain "comment(s) on <arXiv-ID>".
- A response from the original authors is always permitted and must have a Title "Reply to comment(s) on '<title-of-original-paper>'" and the Comments field must contain "reply to comment(s) on <arXiv-ID>" in the comment field.
- In rare cases where the original paper is not on arXiv (see content rules) the arXiv-ID is replaced by a DOI.
- A further chain of responses and counter-responses is allowed as version updates of the original two above; these will not be accepted as new papers with new arXiv-IDs
