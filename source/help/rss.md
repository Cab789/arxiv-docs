# RSS news feeds

Daily updated RSS news feed pages are available for all active subject
areas within arXiv. These are available in RSS format at `https://arxiv.org/rss/` or in Atom format at `https://arxiv.org/atom/`. The URL for each category (whole archive or subject
class) is constructed by appending the category name to
these URLs. For example, the URL for the RSS page for the
Computer Science archive is `https://arxiv.org/rss/cs`.

News feeds are also available for individual subject classes of archives
that have subject classes. A specific subject class is selected by
appending a period (.) and the subject class letters to the URL. For
example, the URL for the Atom page for Mathematics -- Quantum Algebra is
`https://arxiv.org/atom/math.QA`.

Please review the [Terms of Use for arXiv APIs](api/tou.md) before using the
arXiv RSS feeds.

The RSS feed is updated nightly at 5:00 GMT, but will have no content on weekends or other ArXiv holidays. For issues with the RSS feed please contact rss-help@arxiv.org.
